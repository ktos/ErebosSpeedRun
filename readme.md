Code Name "Erebos"
==================

A game about running from the incoming darkness in randomly generated dungeons.

"Darkness", player's enemy is developing different additional powers during
the game, so running from the darkness is becoming more and more challenging.

The player's guide, Kaya, a "good ghost" is also developing additional powers
allowing the player to outsmart the "darkness".
